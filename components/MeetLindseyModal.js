                I'm Lindsey, your new virtual fitness coach. I have been an
                athlete my entire life, I was a competitive swimmer for 13+
                years, so my love for sports and fitness is deep rooted. After
                high school I decided to start competing in IFBB (International
                Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness) bikini figure
                competitions.
                <br />
                <br /> Here is where I really began to dive deep into expanding
                my knowledge of strength training and nutrition. After several
                years I realized the havok these extreme diets and fitness
                approaches were having on my body and my mind, and decided to
                pivot towards finding a more sustainable and balanced lifestyle.
                I went on to discover my passion for group fitness, and sharing
                my knowledge and love for movement with others. The journey to
                where I am today did not come without its trials, I experienced
                many highs and lows, body image dysmorphia, toxic relationships
                with food and fitness, and low self esteem and confidence. All
                of this only fueling my desire to find balance even further.
                <br /> <br />
                Today, I am my happiest, healthiest, strongest, truest self. My
                life is dedicated to helping women become the healthiest
                versions of themselves, unlock the confidence and strength they
                already have within them, change their perspective towards
                fitness to one of celebration, not punishment, inspire them to
                know anything is possible, and guide them along the way, all
                while having the literal BEST time.{' '}
